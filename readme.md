Me writing some thoughts out for future me. It would be nice if someone else thought this was helpful as well

[blog.burtonr.dev](https://blog.burtonr.dev)

## Theme
The theme used is a custom created theme blending the styles of [hugo-agency-theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-agency-theme) and [hugo-dusk](https://github.com/gyorb/hugo-dusk). The code for this theme only lives within this project. If there is any request, or need, I can move it to a separate repository to be used with Hugo by other sites/projects.

## Notes to self...
Add images to the `static/images` directory. Show them in a post with the following:

```
{{< figure src="/images/POST_NAME/IMAGE_NAME.jpg" title="BOLDED_TEXT" caption="ITALICIZED_TEXT" alt="ALT_TEXT" >}}
```
